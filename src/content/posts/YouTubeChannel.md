# How to create a YouTube channel

In this tutorial, we will be developing a Spring Boot application that makes use of JWT authentication for securing an exposed REST API. In this example, we will be making use of hard-coded user values for user authentication. In the next tutorial, we will be implementing Spring Boot + JWT + MYSQL JPA for storing and fetching user credentials. Any user will be able to consume this API only if it has a valid JSON Web Token (JWT). In a previous tutorial, we learned what is JWT and when and how to use it.

This tutorial is explained in the following video:
